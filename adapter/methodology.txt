The AXC Grow Token will consist of two tokens:

- a permissioned token which can only be transfered between white
  listed addresses - each GROW share will correspond to a permissioned
  token and permissioned tokens will be burned and minted to match the
  number of GROW shares outstanding. 

- a permissionless token which will be a vault.  The vault will
  contain the permissioned tokens which are being held by the
  custodian.  The number of permissioned tokens being held by the
  vault can be viewed by looking the tokens held by the vault.

- The TVL of the protocol consists of

(permissioned tokens) * (price of the permissionless tokens)
